% xmobar - Release notes

## Version 0.18 (June 5, 2013)

_New features_

  - All extra argument monitors taking a string (e.g. `-O` for
    `BatteryP`) accept now template variables (see [github #109] and
    [#110]).  Thanks to Todd Lunter.

  - New battery monitor extra argument, `-i`, for the idle status.

_Bug fixes_

  - Safer standard input parsing, avoiding <action> injections.

## Version 0.17 (May 5, 2013)

_New features_

  - Icons support: it's now possible to insert bitmaps in the template
    (Edward O'Callaghan, Alexander Polakov and Tomáš Janoušek).
  - Initial support for reacting to mouse clicks (Alexander Polakov).
  - New `TopP` and `BottomP` alignments, taking left and right
    paddings (thanks to Dmitry Malikov).
  - New `<freeratio>` field for memory monitor (Peter Simons).
  - New `allDesktops` and `overrideRedirect` configuration options,
    providing dock behaviour in tiling WMs (when set to True and False
    respectively). Cf. discussion at [github #105].
  - Experimental `-d` (start as a dock) option, may address [github #67]
    in some window managers.

_Bug fixes_

  - Partial (as reports go) fix for [github #77].
  - Safer volume plugin (Dmitry Malikov).
  - Battery percentage capped at 100% (RJ Regenold).

## Version 0.16 (Dec 3, 2012)

_New features_

  - New monitor `AutoMPD`, which uses asynchronous events to display
    MPD status (thanks to Ben Boeckel).
  - New monitor `BufferedPipeReader` displaying data from multiple
    pipes (thanks to Jochen Keil).
  - New monitor `DynNetwork`, which detects the active interface
    automatically, by Reto Hablützel
  - New monitor, `Locks`, displaying the status of lock keys, by
    Patrick Chilton.
  - Extension for DBUS signal handling (Jochen Keil)
  - Hide/Reveal: one can send signals to xmobar and make it (un)hide
    itself (Jochen again).
  - `PipeReader`'s default text is now configurable, by Reto Hablützel.
  - Dependencies updated to latest mtl and libmpd (thanks to Sergei
    Trofimovich).
  - Dependencies on the deprecated dbus-core removed in favour of
    dbus 0.10 (thanks to Jochen Keil).
  - MPris2 now includes genre and composer among its fields.

_Bug fixes_

  - `DiskIO` now can report overall activity in all partitions of a device
    which is not mounted itself (e.g., sda when sda1, sda3, etc. are
    the mounted partitions).  Thanks to John Soros. See [github #73].
  - `DiskU`, the disk usage monitor, works again correctly on Linux,
    instead of randomly crashing every now and then, and reporting
    wrong used size.
  - When using antialiased fonts, we were causing a memory leak in the
    X server by repeatedly allocating colors that, apparently, the
    server doesn't know how to get rid of (even when told so!).  We're
    caching them now and X server memory doesn't grow.
  - Compilation errors and warnings with GHC 7.6 removed (thanks to
    Raghavendra D Prabhu for his reports in [github #71]).

_Known problems_

Some users have reported problems with xmobar compiled with GHC 7.6 in
ArchLinux: see [github #78] and pointers therein.  Please, send
reports of any problems or successes in that regard so that we can fix
any remaining issues.  Thanks!

## Version 0.15 (June 4, 2012)

_Incompatible changes_

  - `Batt` monitor no longer uses `-c` to specify the charge file: it
    should figure things out by itself (cf. [issue 69]).

_New features_

  - New command line option, `-C`, that allows *adding* commands to
    those specified in the configuration file (Ben Boeckel).
  - Dependency on GHC's threaded runtime has been eliminated.
  - New MPRIS (versions 1 and 2) monitor, by Artem Tarasov.
  - New monitor option `-d` to specify the number of decimal places to
    display for float numbers.  Defaults to 0. See [issue 58].
  - New compilation option `--with_threaded`, to use GHC's threaded
    runtime to compile xmobar.  Disabled by default (cf. discussion in
    [github #36]).

_Bug fixes_

  - Stricter build dependencies versioning in cabal file.
  - [issue 56] vertical alignment of text improved.
  - [issue 64] display of `watts` in `Batt` monitor fixed.
  - [issue 69] miscellaneous battery reporting issues.
  - [issue 67] compilation in DragonFly.
  - DiskIO works also when device path in mtab are symbolic links
    to the real device file.
  - Wireless monitor honours padding settings for ESSID names.
  - CoreTemp monitor fixed for newer kernels ([github #38]).

  - Cpu monitor now also reports `iowait` field ([issue 55]).
  - Battery monitor: the full charge file is now settable in the
    monitor arguments (olpc systems use `charge_full_design`; see

## Version 0.13 (March 28, 2011)

_New features_

  - New `Volume` monitor displaying ALSA soundcards information, by
    Thomas Tuegel.
  - New `ThermalZone` plugin substituting `Thermal` and using linux's
    *sysfs* interface (you need this one if you're using a kernel
    version equal to or above 2.6.37). See [issue 44].
  - xmobar app new has WM_CLASS, WM_NAME and _NET_WM_PID xprops
    ([issue 38]).

_Incompatible changes_

  - In the process of solving [issue 14], we've broken those
    configurations that rely on including alignment separators in the
    input fed to `StdinReader`.
  - The MPD plugin does not accept host and port options anymore: use
    the environment variables MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT instead.
  - The `Mail` plugin now takes a second parameter (a string)
    specifying its alias. As a side-effect, this solves [issue 30].

_Bug fixes_

  - [issue 14] `StdinReader` and other plugins accepting external
    input don't get confused anymore when characters from `alignSep`
    appear in their input.
  - [issue 27] `BottomSize` placement now respects its width argument.
  - [issue 28] Compilation in Mac OS X fixed.
  - [issue 30] `Mail` plugin can be specified anywhere in commands list.
  - [issue 36] Battery monitor now supports non-standard locations of
    the `/sys/class/power_supply/AC/online` file.
  - [issue 40] Battery monitor now supports the new power_now, that
    replaces current_now in linux kernels for v. 2.36 and above.
  - [issue 42] More accurate net monitor rates.
  - DiskIO, Cpu and MultiCpu monitors are also more accurate now.
  - Text is now correctly centered vertically.
  - `FullBM` border spec fixed.

list] and uses a new [source code repository].

Many thanks to Andrea Rossato, xmobar's author and maintainer so far,
for creating xmobar in the first place, and for giving me the chance
to become its maintainer. And a big thanks to Ben Boeckel, Petr Rockai
and Norbert Zeh for their patches.
